# excerpt: 'Building segmentation in large-scale aerial images is challenging, especially for small buildings in dense and cluttered urban environments. Complex building structures with highly varied geometric footprints pose an additional challenge for the building segmentation task in satellite imagery. In this work, we propose to tackle the issue of detecting and segmenting small and complex-shaped buildings in Electro-Optical (EO) and SAR satellite imagery. A novel architecture Deep Multi-scale Aware Overcomplete Network (DeepMAO), is proposed that comprises an overcomplete branch that focuses on fine structural features and an undercomplete (U-Net) branch tasked to focus on coarse, semantic-rich features. Additionally, a novel self-regulating augmentation strategy, Loss-Mix, is proposed to increase pixel representation of misclassified pixels. DeepMAO is simple and efficient in accurately identifying small and geometrically complex buildings. Experimental results on SpaceNet 6 dataset, on both EO and SAR modalities, and the INRIA dataset show that DeepMAO achieves state-ofthe-art building segmentation performance, including small and complex-shaped buildings with a negligible increase in the parameter count. In addition, the presence of the overcomplete branch in DeepMAO helps in handling the speckle noise present in the SAR image modality.'

Swarm robotics has received much spotlight in the past decade in regards to research and has already been deployed in many real life scenarios. From what started to be an interesting application for surveillance, search and rescue based applications has now been scaled to a multitude of applications ranging from the medical industry to industrial warehouse applications. With a plethora of interesting problems seen in such application themes,
our work addresses a problem most relatable to the industrial logistics use case. In this paper, a graph inspired geometric area allocation is done which in turn streamlines the process of task allocation not just efficiently but also reduces infrastructure costs in a traditional industrial setting. A fail safe approach is introduced, wherein if a situation arises where robot(s) fail, then the system would realize and dynamically re-adjust the area
allocation to make sure the pipeline continues unhampered..<br>
