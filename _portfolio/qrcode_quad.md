This is a python server-client code for live video transmission. The RC drone has raspberry pi 3 as its processor. The live video is transmitted from the raspberry pi 3 which is mounted on the RC drone to a laptop which is held by the user(pilot). This code was developed for IIT Bombay Tech Fest competition-"Drone Challenge".<br>
