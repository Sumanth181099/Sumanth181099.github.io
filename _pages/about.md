I'm currently a research assistant at the Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Lab(AIRL) within the Department of Aerospace Engineering at the Indian Institute of Science(IISc), where I work under the guidance of [Prof. Suresh Sundaram](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=5iAMbhMAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) and have collaborated with [Prof. Arjun Jain](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=elmWdycAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) for a brief period. I completed my Bachelors in Electrical and Electronics Engineering in 2021 from PES University, Bangalore, India.<br>
Currently, my work at AIRL is centred towards the semantic segmentation in autonomous driving with the emphasis on domain adaptation, generalization and continual learning. My work extends to the domain of aerial and satellite imagery, encompassing both electro-optical, synthetic aperture radar and thermal image data where the focus is on cross-domain adaptation and also improving the segmentation performance on tiny objects.<br>
Previously, I worked on efficient and structure-aware machine learning models to boost the visual perception abilities of autonomous agents. 

**Research Interests**: I'm keen on exploring how we can have deep neural networks that generalize well to new unseen environments. My areas of interest include domain generalization, domain adaptation, out-of-distribution robustness, continual learning, structure-aware machine learning and also low labeled data learning regimes like few-shot learning and self-supervised learning. I am also interested in improving models' understanding of world knowledge using multi-modal learning. Overall, I aim to develop models that are trustworthy to be deployed in safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving, robot autonomy and biomedical image analysis.
