I'm currently a **Research Assistant** at the **Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Lab(AIRL)** within the Department of Aerospace Engineering at the <i>Indian Institute of Science(IISc)</i>, where I work under the guidance of [Prof. Suresh Sundaram](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=5iAMbhMAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) and have collaborated with [Prof. Arjun Jain](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=elmWdycAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) for a brief period. I completed my Bachelors in Electrical and Electronics Engineering in 2021 from PES University, Bangalore, India.<br>

<h2>Selected Research Experience</h2>
<ul>
<li>Currently, my work at AIRL is focused on semantic segmentation for safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving, with an emphasis on domain adaptation, generalization, and continual learning.</li>
<li>My work extends to the domain of aerial and satellite imagery, encompassing both electro-optical, synthetic aperture radar, and thermal image data where the focus is on cross-domain adaptation and also improving the segmentation performance on tiny objects.</li>
<li>Previously, I worked on efficient and structure-aware machine learning models to boost the visual perception abilities of autonomous agents.</li><br>

<h2>Research Interests</h2>
I'm keen on developing models that are trustworthy to be deployed in safety. My areas of interest include:
<ul>
<li>domain generalization, domain adaptation, out-of-distribution robustness, continual learning, structure-aware machine learning and also low labeled data learning regimes like few-shot learning and self-supervised learning.</li> 
<li>I am also interested in improving models' understanding of world knowledge using <i>multi-modal learning</i>.</li>
</ul><br>
Overall, I aim to develop models that are trustworthy to be deployed in safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving, robot autonomy and biomedical image analysis.
